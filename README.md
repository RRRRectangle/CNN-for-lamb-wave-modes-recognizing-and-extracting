# CNN-for-lamb-wave-modes-recognizing-and-extracting
 Here is the CNN codes for lamb wave vibrating modes extracting. "modeCNN.py" is the network with dropout and "modeCNN1.py" is the network with batch normalization.
 "mode_recognizatino.py" is the codes for front interface.
 With considerable training data, the network would be able to recognize and classify the input images into the classes sorted by user(in "modeCNN.py" or "modeCNN1.py").
